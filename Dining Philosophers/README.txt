Project 2 CECS 326

How to use the Files:
0. Ensure that all 4 files, are located in the same directory:
 - This includes: 
     * DiningPhilosophers.java, 
     * DiningServer.java, 
     * DiningServerImpl.java, 
     * and Philosopher.java

1. Run DiningPhilosophers.java
Do this one of two ways:
 - Use an IDE of your choice
 - or use a terminal/command prompt window (assuming you have the JDK installed)
     * type "javac DiningPhilosophers.java" to compile
     * then type "java DiningPhilosophers" to run

2. The terminal should loop through the dining philosophers like:

Philosopher 0 is thinking
Philosopher 1 is thinking
Philosopher 2 is thinking
Philosopher 3 is thinking
Philosopher 4 is thinking
Philosopher 0 is hungry
Philosopher 0 is eating
Philosopher 3 is hungry
Philosopher 3 is eating
Philosopher 2 is hungry
Philosopher 0 is hungry
Philosopher 0 is eating
Philosopher 1 is hungry
Philosopher 4 is hungry
...

3. Terminate the program by closing the IDE or command window.
